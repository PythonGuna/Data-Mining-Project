# Data-Mining-Project
# Garbage Image Classification

This project involves classifying garbage images into various categories such as 'paper', 'glass', 'metal', 'trash', 'cardboard', and 'plastic'. The model was trained using the **TorchVision** module, leveraging deep learning techniques for image classification.


## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop an image classification model to automatically categorize garbage into six different categories:
- **Paper**
- **Glass**
- **Metal**
- **Trash**
- **Cardboard**
- **Plastic**

The model was trained on a dataset of labeled garbage images using the **TorchVision** library for feature extraction and model building. The classification model achieved an impressive accuracy of **94%**.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries.
